# FreeRTOS-RISCV

This repo contains an official FreeRTOS release (actually 10.2.1) including its RISC-V port. 

On top of it there is the blinky example (in RISC-V-HiFive1_e-FreedomStudio) which runs on the HiFive1 board as well
as on [RISCV-VP](https://github.com/Minres/RISCV-VP) demonstrating the capabilities of the [RISCV-VP](https://github.com/Minres/RISCV-VP).
